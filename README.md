Basic operating system with keyboard shortcut commands 
to run the file there are instruction in the boot_instructions file

As of the creation of this repo i have spent 7 days working on it and am happy with my progress

there is no bootloader or kernel, none of it is programmed in c, just assembly
planning on adding a bootloader and all that at some point

Thanks eprograms for the inspiration ly
